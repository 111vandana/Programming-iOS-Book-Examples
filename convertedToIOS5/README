I thought it might be instructional for readers, even without the book yet having been revised for iOS 5 and Xcode 4.2, at least to have new versions of the example code. So I've started converting them. There are some interesting differences wrought by LLVM 3.0 and ARC (not to mention the new project templates). Also I'm trying to illustrate new iOS 5 features, in approximately the places where I'd be disussing them in a new edition.
