The downloadable code and screenshots for my book, "Programming iOS 5: Fundamentals of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch Development," published by O'Reilly in March 2012, have now been moved off to the subfolder iOS5bookExamples.

At the top level, I've begun revising the examples to fit iOS 6. So far I've revised the existing examples for chapters 1 through 13. No new examples have been added yet.
