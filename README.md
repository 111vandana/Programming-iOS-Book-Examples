The downloadable code and screenshots for my book, "Programming iOS 5: Fundamentals of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch Development," published by O'Reilly in March 2012, have now been moved off to the subfolder iOS5bookExamples.

At the top level, I've begun revising the examples to fit iOS 6. So far I've revised the existing examples for chapters 1 through 18.

Changes include:

* Use new literals and subscripting for arrays, dictionaries, numbers.

* Use autosynthesis of properties.

* Use constraints (instead of frame) to position and size subviews, whenever this is relational (and doesn't get in the way of the example).

* Illustrate some newly available CIFilters.

* Illustrate new UIView/UIGestureRecognizer interaction.

New examples:

* Further illustrate use of constraints (ch 14), esp. in company with animation (ch 17).
