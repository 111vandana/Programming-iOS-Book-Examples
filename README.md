These are the **complete downloadable code examples** for my books, _iOS 7 Programming Fundamentals_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032465.do>) and _Programming iOS 7_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031017.do>).

Together, these two books constitute the 4th edition of my previous books, _Programming iOS 4_, _Programming iOS 5_, and _Programming iOS 6_. The book was getting awfully big (over 1150 pages in the 3rd edition, and growing); so for the 4th edition we have broken it into two volumes, something that I have always wanted to do anyway. I hope readers will find that this makes the book more tractable (both figuratively and literally).

The obvious place to split the volumes was after Chapter 13 (end of Part III). Thus, the structure of the two new books is exactly the same as the structure of the previous editions, but divided in two groups: _iOS 7 Programming Fundamentals_ contains old chapters 1–13, and _Programming iOS 7_ contains old chapters 14–40.

Of course, in the second book, the chapter numbering now starts over at 1 (old Chapter 14 becomes new Chapter 1, and so on). I have not yet renamed the folders containing the examples, however. Thus *they still have the old chapter numbers*, as if the two books were still one book. I'm used to the old numbering, and old habits are hard to break, so cut me some slack. I'll get around to it eventually...

Also, the page numbers in the folder names are currently just placeholders, designed to keep the examples in the right order. When I rename the folders, I'll make the page numbers correspond better to the pages of the printed books. 

If you find these examples helpful and you haven't purchased the books, please consider doing so.

The downloadable code and screenshots for the previous editions — _Programming iOS 6_, published by O'Reilly in March 2013; _Programming iOS 5,_ published by O'Reilly in March 2012; and _Programming iOS 4_, published by O'Reilly in May 2011 — have been moved off to subfolders "iOS6bookExamples", "iOS5bookExamples", and "iOS4bookExamples".
