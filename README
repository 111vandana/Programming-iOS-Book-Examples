This is the downloadable code for my book, "Programming iOS 4: Fundamentals of iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch Development," published by O'Reilly in May 2011.

NOTE: As of now, I have created downloadable code for only about the first 19 chapters of the book. More to follow!

The idea is that if you have the paper edition of the book, you shouldn't have to enter code examples by hand to try them out. And if you have an electronic edition of the book, copying and pasting the code and creating the surrounding Xcode project could be tricky.

The downloadable code examples here are all couched as Xcode projects. So all you have to do is open a project in Xcode and read it, build it, run it. I've tried to comment the code in such a way as to show you where to concentrate your attention.

In some projects, multiple examples are combined; usually in this case you are instructed to changed a #define from 1 to 2 and so forth and then run the project again.

Readers are encouraged to use this code as a starting place. Try tweaking things to see what difference it makes.

You may use this code in your own projects. What you may not do is pass off my examples as your own. If you cite code or anything else from the book, give proper credit.

If you find any issues with this code, please let me know or supply a patch.
